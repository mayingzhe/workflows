# How to Contribute to DifyHub Workflows

First off, thank you for considering contributing! Your contributions are what make DifyHub a valuable resource for the entire Dify community.

We welcome all high-quality workflow submissions. To ensure a smooth review process and maintain the quality of our library, please follow these guidelines.

**(中文用户请阅读 [CONTRIBUTING_CN.md (中文贡献指南)](CONTRIBUTING_CN.md))**

## Submitting a New Workflow

All new workflow submissions must be made via a **Pull Request (PR)**.

### 1. Repository Structure

This repository is organized by category. Please place your workflow in the most relevant sub-directory under `/workflows`.
- **Good:** `workflows/social-media/ai-tweet-generator`
- **Good:** `workflows/rag/qdrant-pdf-qa`
- **Bad:** `workflows/my-awesome-workflow`

If you are unsure about the category, feel free to create a new one that makes sense.

### 2. Required Files

Each workflow submission (your new folder) **must** contain:
1.  **`workflow.yml`**:
    * This is the raw exported file from your Dify application.
    * **[IMPORTANT] You MUST rename your exported file (e.g., `My Workflow.yml` or `我的工作流.yml`) to exactly `workflow.yml`.**
    * This allows users to import it directly into Dify and enables our automation system.
2.  `README.md`: A markdown file that explains your workflow (using our template).

**We highly recommend adding:**
3.  `screenshot-workflow.png`: A screenshot of the workflow graph from the Dify UI.
4.  `screenshot-run.png`: A screenshot of the "Debug & Preview" panel, showing an example of the input and output.

### 3. The `README.md` Template (Mandatory)

Your `README.md` is the "manual" for your workflow. It must be clear and helpful. Please **copy and paste the template below** into your `README.md` file and fill it out. **The `Tags:` line is mandatory.**

```markdown
# [Workflow Name]

**Author:** `[Your GitHub Username]`
**Tags:** `language:english | language:chinese`, `tag2`, `tag3`

A brief, one-sentence description of what this workflow does.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Set Up API Keys:**
    * This workflow requires the following API keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
    * Explain where to get them and how to add them in Dify's "Credentials" section.
2.  **Configure Tools:**
    * Does the user need to configure any tools, like a database connection or a Google Search API?
3.  **Run the Workflow:**
    * Explain how to test it (e.g., "Provide a URL in the 'input' node...").

## 🛠️ Workflow Nodes (Optional but Recommended)

A brief overview of the main nodes and their roles:

* **Start Node:** Takes a user query (string).
* **LLM Node:** Summarizes the input.
* **End Node:** Returns the summary.

## 📸 Screenshots (Highly Recommended)
